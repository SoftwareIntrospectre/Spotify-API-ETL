(pg 317-318)

1. Families of related algorithms
2. An alternative to subclassing
3. Strategies eliminate conditional statements
4. A choice of implementations
    * Potential drawback
        - Use only wnen the variation in behavior is relevant to Clients

5. Clients must be aware of different Strategies
6. Communication overhead between Strategy and Context
7. Increased number of objects
    - Can potentially reduce this overhead by implementing Strategies as stateless objects (FP?)
