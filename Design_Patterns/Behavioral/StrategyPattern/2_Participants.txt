* Strategy (Compositor)
    - declares an interface common to all supported algorithms.
        -- Context uses this interface to call the algorithm defined by a ConcreteStrategy

* ConcreteStrategy (SimpleCOmpositor, TexCompositor, ArrayCompositor)
    - implements the algorithm using the Strategy interface


* Context (Composition)
    - is configured with a ConcreteStrategy object
    - maintains a reference to Strategy object
    - may define an interface that lets Strategy access its data
